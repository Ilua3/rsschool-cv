### About Myself:
Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree at BSUIR. I completed my bachelor’s degree in 2024. During my bachelor’s studies, I became familiar with various programming languages such as Java, C(++), VHDL, and also worked with databases in Microsoft Access and HTML markup for Android applications. I would like to note that most of my time during my studies was dedicated to the C++ language in the programming environment for Arduino and STM32 microcontrollers.
